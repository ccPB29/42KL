# Instruction
## OS Choice: Debian
For this project, I chose **Debian**.
* **Pros:** It is beginner-friendly, minimalist, and highly stable. Because Debian's stable branch undergoes rigorous testing, it rarely crashes in a server environment. Furthermore, its package managers (`apt` for simple, manual fixes and `aptitude` for offering intelligent conflict-resolution choices) are highly reliable.
* **Cons:** Because it prioritizes stability over new features, its software packages are often older.
* **Rocky Linux (Alternative):** Rocky Linux strictly follows enterprise security standards. While it offers robust, enterprise-grade features, it has a steeper learning curve and is more complex for beginners.
